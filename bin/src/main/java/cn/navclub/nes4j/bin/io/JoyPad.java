     * required to get the button states, after which the buttons can be read back one at a time.

     * Though both are polled from a write to $4016, controller 1 is read through $4016, and

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Each read reports one bit at a time through D0. The first 8 reads will indicate which buttons
     * or directions are pressed (1 if pressed, 0 if not pressed). All subsequent reads will return 1
     * on official Nintendo brand controllers but may return 0 on third party controllers such as the
     * U-Force.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Status for each controller is returned as an 8-bit report in the following order: A, B, Select,
     * Start, Up, Down, Left, Right.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In the NES and Famicom, the top three (or five) bits are not driven, and so retain the bits of
     * the previous byte on the bus. Usually this is the most significant byte of the address of the
     * controller portâ€”0x40. Certain games (such as Paperboy) rely on this behavior and require that
     * reads from the controller ports return exactly $40 or $41 as appropriate. See: Controller
     * reading: unconnected data lines.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When no controller is connected, the corresponding status bit will report 0. This is due to
     * the presence of internal pull-up resistors, and the internal inverter. (See: Controller reading)
